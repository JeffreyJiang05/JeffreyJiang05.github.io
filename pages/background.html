                    Algal blooms refer to an overgrowth of algae in water. However, not all of them are harmful as only a few types of 
                    algae produce toxins. Harmful algae blooms (HABs) are blooms that negatively impact humans, marine and freshwater ecosystems, 
                    and coastal economics. The two different types of harmful algae blooms are marine HABs, which discolor the water in shades of 
                    red and brown, and freshwater HABs, which discolor the water bright green or blue-green. Like most environmental issues, HABs 
                    have various causes like nutrient pollution and factory wastewater discharge, and many effects like decreases in biodiversity 
                    and changes in water quality. Harmful algal blooms are a problem in all 50 states, and they can have a severe impact on our health, 
                    economy, and environment if we don’t address them.

            <h2>Common Types of Algae Bloom</h2>
            <p>
                Algal blooms can be harmful and toxic, but not all of them are. There are hundreds of different types of algae and only a few produce toxins. 
                Even so, a bloom doesn’t have to produce toxins to be considered environmentally harmful. Blooms are harmful by negatively impacting humans, 
                marine and freshwater environments, and coastal economies.

                    <strong>Marine HABs:</strong> Dinoflagellates and diatoms, different types of microalgae, are usually the cause of algal blooms in marine waters. 
                    The blooms discolor the water in different shades of red and brown. Marine HABs produce toxins that can cause respiratory irritation in humans, 
                    shellfish contamination, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, ciguatera poisoning in fish, and can affect the central nervous system of fish, marine mammals, 
                    and birds.

                <li>
                    <strong>Freshwater HABs:</strong> Cyanobacteria, a type of blue-green algae, are usually the cause of algal blooms in freshwater which discolor the water bright green or blue-green. 
                    Cyanobacterial HABs commonly cause gastrointestinal illness in humans, and mortality in pets, livestock, and wildlife.
