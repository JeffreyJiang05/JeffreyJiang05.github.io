            <h2>Prevention</h2>

            <p>
                The legislative or policy changes implemented in the Seto Inland Sea and other locations demonstrate that 
                control of sewage or waste discharges has the potential to prevent certain types of HABs (Harmful Algae Blooms). 
                In other words, implementing sewage reduction strategies is encouraged.
            </p>

            <h2>Control</h2>

            <p>
                There are five general categories that can be used to combat and suppress HAB’s. These include: 
                mechanical, biological, chemical, genetic and environmental control. 
            </p>

            <div class="gallery">
                <div class="panel" style="background: #f6bd60">
                    <strong>Mechanical control</strong> involves the removal of HAB cells from the water by dispersing clay over the water surface. 
                    This creates the clay particles aggregate with each other and with HAB cells, removing those cells through sedimentation. 
                </div>
                <div class="panel" style="background: #65f660">
                    There are also a variety of organisms that could theoretically be used to control HABs, such as <strong>biological control</strong> 
                    which is used extensively in agriculture, such as in the release of sterile males or the use of pheromones to control insect pests, 
                    but there is still considerable opposition to the concept of releasing one organism to control another in the ocean.
                </div>
                <div class="panel" style="background: #60a1f6">
                    <strong>Chemical control</strong> relies on toxic chemical release, including the potential development of species-specific chemical 
                    control agents. However, chemical control has not been actively pursued by the HAB community, presumably because of the general 
                    feeling that it will be difficult and perhaps impossible to find an environmentally acceptable chemical that would target a particular 
                    HAB species but not cause widespread mortality of other organisms. 
                </div>
                <div class="panel" style="background: #f660bd">
                    In addition, there are numerous examples where <strong>genetic</strong> approaches have been used successfully in terrestrial agriculture, 
                    such as the engineering of plant crops so that they are capable of producing their own insecticides. Similar genetic manipulations might 
                    be used on marine pests such as HABs. It might be possible, to engineer a HAB species so that it no longer produces toxins. 
                </div>
                <div class="panel" style="background: #f68060">
                    The last of the five control strategies is <strong>environmental</strong> manipulation—physical or chemical modifications of the environment 
                    so that either the target species is affected and/or a natural or introduced bio-controlled species is enhanced. For HABs, this might involve 
                    the large-scale manipulation of nutrient levels in coastal waters through pollution control policies. On shorter time scales, environmental 
                    manipulation becomes more difficult to envision but might include efforts to alter water circulation or residence time, such as through 
                    dredging or opening of channels.
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Technology</h2>

            <p>
                There are now analytical techniques combining chromatographic and mass spectrometry techniques that have been developed for all major HAB toxins. 
                In addition, simple test kits have been developed which allow for inexpensive, rapid testing for toxins. These show great promise for use in 
                screening samples, avoiding costly analysis for the many samples that are negative in monitoring programs and show promise to allow remote 
                areas (such as offshore shellfish beds) to be harvested. Another important management need is detection and tracking which is why satellite 
                remote sensing is now used operationally to detect HABs in the Gulf of Mexico, and with simple transport models, forecasts are now issued of 
                impending landfall or exposure.
